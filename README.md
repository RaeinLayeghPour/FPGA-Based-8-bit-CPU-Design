## Features

- Fully custom 8-bit CPU design
- Components: Instruction Fetch, Decode, Execute (ALU), Register File, Program Counter
- Basic instruction set: LOAD, STORE, ADD, SUB, JMP, and conditional operations
- Memory-mapped I/O support
- Developed in VHDL
- Tested and synthesized using Quartus II

---

## Tech Stack & Tools

- **HDL:** VHDL
- **Tools:** Intel Quartus II
- **Simulation:** ModelSim
- **Hardware Target:** Altera DE2 Board - Cyclone II

---

## Getting Started

1. Open your project in Quartus II.
2. Add source files from `src/`, constraints from `constr/`.
3. Simulate using testbenches in `tb/` to verify CPU behaviour.
4. Synthesize and generate the bitstream under `synth/`.
5. Upload the bitstream to your FPGA board and observe CPU operation via LEDs or serial.
